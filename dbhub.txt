Hi Izzet,

We (dbhub.io) have received a request for changing
your username from "izzeterdogan" to "izzet".

We don't have a working email address for you though,
(just the placeholder @dbhub.io one).

So, this is us trying to confirm things with you.

Please email us (support@newdash.io, and we'll
get it done. :)
